<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
This tutorial is targeted at a broad set of database systems and applications people. It is intended to let the attendees better appreciate what is really behind the covers of many of the modern database systems (e.g., NoSQL and NewSQL systems), going beyond the hype associated with these open source and commercial systems. The capabilities and limitations of such systems will be addressed. Some application case studies will also be presented. An outline of problems for which no adequate solutions exist will be included. Such problems could be fertile grounds for new research work.

The Big Data era is upon us: data is being generated, collected and analyzed at an unprecedented scale, and data-driven decision making is sweeping through 
all aspects of society. Since the value of data explodes when it can be linked and fused with other data, addressing the big data integration (BDI) challenge 
is critical to realizing the promise of Big Data.
DI differs from traditional data integration in many dimensions: (i) the number of data sources, even for a single domain, has grown to be in the tens of thousands, 
(ii) many of the data sources are very dynamic, as a huge amount of newly collected data are continuously made available, (iii) the data sources are extremely 
heterogeneous in their structure, with considerable variety even for substantially similar entities, and (iv) the data sources are of widely differing qualities, 
with significant differences in the coverage, accuracy and timeliness of data provided. This tutorial explores the progress that has been made by the data integration community on the topics of schema mapping, record linkage and data fusion in addressing these novel challenges faced by big data integration, and identifies a range of open problems for the community.

Just-in-time compilation of SQL queries into native code has recently emerged as a viable technique for query processing and an alternative to the dominant interpretation-based approach. We present the salient results of research in this fresh area, addressing all as- pects of the query processing stack: from traditional query compilation techniques, to compilation in man- aged environments, to state-of-the-art approaches on intermediate and native code emission. Throughout the discussion we refer and draw analogies to the gen- eral code generation techniques used in contemporary compiler technology. At the same time we describe the open research problems of the area.

<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Designing scalable transaction processing systems on modern multicore hardware has been a challenge for almost a decade. The typical characteristics of transaction processing workloads lead to a high degree of unbounded communication on multicores for conventional system designs.
In this tutorial, we initially present a systematic way of eliminating scalability bottlenecks of a transaction processing system, which is based on minimizing unbounded communication. Then, we show several techniques that apply the presented methodology to minimize logging, locking, latching etc. related bottlenecks of transaction processing systems. In parallel, we demonstrate the internals of the Shore-MT storage manager and how they have evolved over the years in terms of scalability on multicore hardware through such techniques. We also teach how to use Shore-MT with the various design options it offers through its sophisticated application layer Shore-Kits and simple Metadata Frontend.

<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Advances in operating system and storage-level virtualization technologies have enabled the effective consolidation of heterogeneous applications in a shared cloud infrastructure. Novel research challenges arising from this new shared environment, include load balancing, workload estimation, resource isolation, machine replication, live migration, and an emergent need of automation to handle large scale operations with minimal manual intervention. Given that databases are at the core of most applications that are deployed in the cloud, database management systems (DBMSs) represent a very important technology component that needs to be virtualized in order to realize the benefits of virtualization from autonomic management of data-intensive applications in large scale data-centers. <br>
This tutorial is organized in three parts. In part one, we provide a general background of the current state-of-the-art of virtualization technologies on modern cloud environment in particular, covering in depth some crucial advances. In part two, we explore consolidated shared storage systems and virtualization techniques used to ensure fair access between applications. For part three, we focus on some of the shortcomings of general purpose operating systems and storage-level virtualization technologies when applied to DBMSs and discuss recent research and development in this space. We will touch on several open problems, providing pointers to areas of research we expect to be growing and for which simple naive solutions are not likely to be very effective. <br>
The goal of this tutorial is to survey the techniques used in providing elasticity in virtual machine systems, shared storage systems, and survey database research on multitenant architectures and elasticity primitives. This foundation of core Database as a Service advances, together with a primer of important related topics in OS and storage-level virtualization, are central for anyone that wants to operate in this area of research. At the end of the tutorial we expect attendees to be well oriented in this exciting research area and ready to participate in it.

Online social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter have become very popular in the past decade. Users register to online social networks in order to keep in touch with their friends and family, learn about their news, get recommendations from them, and engage in online social events. As mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, GPS devices) became ubiquitous, location-based social networking services (e.g., Foursquare and Facebook Places) are getting more and more popular. For instance, as of September 2012, Foursquare claims to have over 25 million people worldwide, and over billions of check-ins with millions more every day. Users, in a location-based social network, are associated with a geo-location, and might alert friends when visiting a venue (e.g., restaurant, bar) by checking-in on their mobile phones (e.g., iPhone, Android). The rise of location-based social networking applications has led to the emergence of both social networking and mobility side by side, which led to the rise of new research challenges and opportunities. This tutorial presents the state-of-the-art research that lies at the intersection of both: Social Networking and Mobility. Data management research in social networking is mainly concerned with managing users social interactions and collaboration, storing / retrieving social media (e.g., Microblogs, News Feed), and analyzing users behavior. Data management research in mobility focuses on handling user GeoSpatial location and contextual information. This tutorial takes an overarching approach by surveying the research that combines both social networking and mobility from four different perspectives: (1) Microblog search and social news feed queries, (2) Recommendation Services, (3) Crowdsourcing, and (4) Social Media Visualization. We finally highlight the risks and threats (e.g., privacy) that result from combining mobility and social networking, and we conclude the tutorial by summarizing and presenting some open research directions.
