				<a href="">Vector Search and Databases</a>
        		<br/> 
        		by Yannis Papakonstantinou (Google).
				<p/>
				Semantic search ability, via embedding (vectors) and vector indexing, has been added to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) databases in order to enable GenAI applications. The inclusion of vectors in databases enables developers to build GenAI applications on their familiar and trusted SQL environment, while being sure that the vectors are up-to-date and transactionally consistent. 
				The inclusion of vectors in databases raises two R&D questions: First, can databases with vector abilities perform as well as purpose-built vector databases in pure vector search? Second, what are the opportunities and respective R&D challenges that emerge at the intersection of structured data and vectors? In response to the first question, we present the GCP AlloyDB vector indexing (see <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/scann_for_alloydb_whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>). In response to the second question, we discuss how the GCP AlloyDB enables unified SQL access to structured data and vectors. For example, queries that involve joins, filters and vector similarity. We show that databases with vector abilities have fundamental intrinsic ease-of-use and performance advantages (over standalone purpose-built vector databases) in processing such queries while novel query optimization and plan execution work turns the fundamental advantages into material ones.

				<a href="">From Truck to Racecar: Revving up Transactional Throughput 1000x in an Analytical Engine</a>
        		<br/> 
        		by Jonathan Dees (Snowflake).
				<p/>
				Originally designed for efficient analytical data processing, Snowflake has recently introduced hybrid tables, seamlessly integrating transactional and analytical workloads. We explore the nuanced approach required to optimize performance for short-running transactional queries in contrast to analytical queries, resulting in a 1000x speedup. We'll share the challenges we encountered, the strategic steps we implemented, and the insights gained along the way.

				<a href="">Deletion Vectors: No-Regrets Row-Level Updates in Delta Lake</a>
        		<br/> 
        		by Bart Samwel (Databricks).
				<p/>
				Fine-grained updates to traditional Parquet data lakes are inefficient because they require rewriting entire Parquet files even to update only a single row. In recent years, open Lakehouse table formats such as Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg and Apache Hudi have each introduced support for row-level updates. In this talk, we will discuss why row-level updates are important for common workloads. We will then dive into Delta Lake's Deletion Vectors and how they enable row-level updates with virtually no overhead. And finally, we will do a comparative analysis with the techniques that other Lakehouse table formats use to support row-level updates: Iceberg's Position Deletes, and Hudi's Merge-on-Read tables, and show how Deletion Vectors improves on these techniques.<p/>

				<a href="">How I Learned to Stop Worrying About Benchmarks</a>
        		<br/> 
        		by Hannes Muhleisen (DuckDB Labs).
				<p/>
				Data management systems developers are obsessed with benchmarks. As a result, their systems are, too. Moving only slightly away from the over-trodden paths of TPC-H can yield surprising results. Yet users in the real world are unlikely to only ever run benchmarks, instead, their workloads are diverse, messy, and hard to capture in a consensus benchmark specification. In my talk, I will discuss the DuckDB teams' approach to benchmarks and performance, which prioritizes robustness over peak performance on specific queries.<p/>
