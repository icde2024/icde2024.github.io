				<a href="">Vector Search and Databases</a>
        		<br/> 
        		by Yannis Papakonstantinou (Google).
				<p/>
				Semantic search ability, via embedding (vectors) and vector indexing, has been added to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) databases in order to enable GenAI applications. The inclusion of vectors in databases confers many of the traditional benefits of databases: Developers can now develop GenAI applications on their familiar and trusted databases. Furthermore, developers can be sure that the vectors are also up-to-date and transactionally consistent. The rapid adoption of the postgres pgvector extension is evidence of the appreciation of these benefits by the database developer community. 
				<br/>
				The inclusion of vectors in databases raises three R&D questions: 
				First, can databases with vector abilities perform as well as purpose-built vector databases in pure vector search? 
				Second, what are the opportunities and respective R&D challenges that emerge at the intersection of structured data and vectors? 
				Finally, what does it take to facilitate and align the experience of SQL developers with the world of vector management and vector indexing?
				<br/>
				In response to the first question, using the postgres-compatible GCP AlloyDB as a successful case study, we show that databases with vector indexing can be essentially as efficient as purpose-built implementations even in pure vector search. In particular, we present the AlloyDB work on vector indexing. Fundamentally, the tree-based AlloyDB vector index is based on the memory-based ScaNN library developed by Google Research over the last twelve years. ScaNN is the indexing engine behind Google search, Ads, Youtube and many other properties. We discuss the steps that AlloyDB took in order to deliver ScaNN-based performance that is essentially identical to a dedicated ScaNN server, when the index fits in memory. While the transfer of many algorithmic features of ScaNN into postgres was relatively straightforward, deep system-level innovation was needed for others. We present as a case study of the latter the performance gains that the ScaNN library draws from sophisticated SIMD-friendly quantization methods and the storage-level innovations that AlloyDB introduced in order to replicate such gains in its database setting.
				<br/>
				In response to the second question, we discuss the functionality of AlloyDB that allows unified SQL access to structured data and vectors. For example, queries that involve joins, filters and vector similarity in order to answer questions such as ``find the engineering tickets that have originated from the same organization and are most similar to the given incoming ticket". We show that databases with vector abilities have fundamental intrinsic ease-of-use and performance advantages (over standalone purpose-built vector databases) in processing such queries, but careful query optimization and plan execution work is required in order to turn the fundamental advantages into material ones. We show AlloyDB's work on queries featuring filters, joins and vector similarity as a case study of such work.
				<br/>
				Finally, we discuss the third question (facilitate SQL developer experience). We discuss the value and respective R&D challenges in bringing the declarativeness and automatic optimization that SQL users always expect, into the vector world. We briefly present as case studies the AlloyDB works on index autotuning and incremental vector index maintenance.
				<br/>
				In conclusion, databases have intrinsic fundamental advantages for any organization whose use cases require the maintenance of both structured data and vectors. In the GenAI era, it behooves that the database community pursues the work needed to turn these "in principle" advantages into material advantages.

				<a href="">Deletion Vectors: No-Regrets Row-Level Updates in Delta Lake</a>
        		<br/> 
        		by Bart Samwel (Databricks).
				<p/>
				Fine-grained updates to traditional Parquet data lakes are inefficient because they require rewriting entire Parquet files even to update only a single row. In recent years, open Lakehouse table formats such as Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg and Apache Hudi have each introduced support for row-level updates. In this talk, we will discuss why row-level updates are important for common workloads. We will then dive into Delta Lake's Deletion Vectors and how they enable row-level updates with virtually no overhead. And finally, we will do a comparative analysis with the techniques that other Lakehouse table formats use to support row-level updates: Iceberg's Position Deletes, and Hudi's Merge-on-Read tables, and show how Deletion Vectors improves on these techniques.<p/>

				<a href="">How I Learned to Stop Worrying About Benchmarks</a>
        		<br/> 
        		by Hannes Mühleisen (DuckDB Labs).
				<p/>
				Data management systems developers are obsessed with benchmarks. As a result, their systems are, too. Moving only slightly away from the over-trodden paths of TPC-H can yield surprising results. Yet users in the real world are unlikely to only ever run benchmarks, instead, their workloads are diverse, messy, and hard to capture in a consensus benchmark specification. In my talk, I will discuss the DuckDB teams' approach to benchmarks and performance, which prioritizes robustness over peak performance on specific queries.<p/>
