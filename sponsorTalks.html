					<br/><span style="color:green">by Chuanhui Yang (CTO, OceanBase)</span>
					<p/>
					OceanBase is a distributed SQL database built from scratch from 2010 by Ant Group. Initially, it was used by all mission critical systems in Alipay and then extended to more than 1000 external customers outside Alipay. It started as a distributed OLTP database, but more and more customers used it in mixed workload scenarios such as OLAP and NOSQL. This talk will mainly focus on the technical challenges from distributed OLTP to HTAP, such as column storage, resource isolation, complex queries, multi-model in distributed SQL database.
					<p/>
					<b>Chuanhui Yang</b>, also known by his nickname "Rizhao," serves as the Chief Technology Officer for OceanBase, a native distributed database developed by Ant Group. His areas of expertise include large-scale cloud computing systems and distributed databases. In 2010, he joined OceanBase as one of its founding members. He has played a pivotal role in every phase of OceanBase's architecture design and technology development, leading to its successful implementation across Ant Group. Additionally, Yang led the team that twice broke world records in the TPC-C benchmarks. He is the author of "Large-scale Distributed Storage Systems: Theory Analysis and Practical Framework" and contributed to "Analysis of OceanBase Database Source Code." Currently, Yang Chuanhui and his team at OceanBase are dedicated to creating a next-generation enterprise-level distributed database that is more open, flexible, efficient, and user-friendly.
