					<strong>Abstract:</strong><br/> 
					The last few years have been marked by several breakthroughs in the domain of generative AI. Large language models such as GPT-4 are able to solve a plethora of tasks, ranging from text and code generation to multimodal data analysis, without task-specific training data.<br/>
					This tutorial, targeted at database researchers without prior background in language models, introduces language models as well as relevant use cases in the context of data management. The tutorial covers the fundamental principles enabling language models, including the Transformer architecture, pre-training, and alignment. Furthermore, the tutorial will show how to use language models in practice, leveraging OpenAI's GPT model to build a natural language query interface as a demonstration. Finally, the tutorial will discuss recent research exploiting language models in the context of data management.

					<p/>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong><br/> 
						As the field of data science continues to evolve, bipartite graphs have emerged as a fundamental structure in numerous applications, drawing significant interest from both academic and industrial communities. Bipartite graphs are a specific type of graph consisting of two distinct sets of vertices, where connections only occur between vertices of different sets. Examples include e-commerce networks and biological networks. Analytics of bipartite graphs has become an important research topic in the era of big data. This tutorial aims to shed light on analysis methods for bipartite graphs, categorizing them into three areas: classical models, learning-based models, and application-driven models. We start by outlining the importance of bipartite graph analytics, and the unique challenges that need to be addressed. Then, we conduct a thorough review of existing works on bipartite graph analytics. We also compare and analyze the models and solutions in these works. Finally, we point out new research directions.

				<td class="tblCellCnt">
					<p/>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong><br/> 
						Data that is recorded about the operations of an organization constitutes a valuable source of information for monitoring and improvement. Specific use cases include the assessment of compliance to legal regulations, the analysis of performance bottlenecks, or the optimization of resource utilization. In recent years, a plethora of algorithms for operational analysis using data series, summarized as process mining, have been developed to support these use cases. Data series often contain sensitive information, though, about the individuals that act as service consumers or service providers. Personal information is only partially hidden by obfuscation and pseudonymization and potential privacy breaches need to be prevented for ethical, legal, and economic reasons.<br/>This tutorial is devoted to methods for privacy-aware analysis using data series. It covers essential notions, reviews privacy-disclosure attacks, and outlines techniques to give formal privacy guarantees while largely maintaining the data’s utility for operational analysis. The discussion is structured by the adopted perspective on the privacy of individuals, and the degree to which a data series contains contextual information.

				<td class="tblCellCnt">
					<p/>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong><br/> 
						Query optimizers are an essential component of relational database management systems (RDBMSs) as they search for an execution plan that is expected to be optimal for a given query. However, they commonly use parameter estimates that are often inaccurate and make assumptions that may not hold in practice. Consequently, the optimizer may select suboptimal execution plans at runtime, when these estimates and assumptions are not valid, which may result in poor query performance. Therefore, query optimizers do not sufficiently support the robustness of the database system.
						In this tutorial we aim to explore the notion of robustness of a query execution plan, as well as how robustness is evaluated or even further supported. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive definition of robustness in this context. Next, we review the approaches proposed in the literature to address the issue of robustness, including techniques that rely on query re-optimization, discovering parameters, quantifying robustness, as well as recent techniques that employ machine learning. We emphasize the comparison of traditional cost-model-based and recent ML-based techniques concerning their capacity to address the issue of robustness in query optimization. Finally, we discuss the limitations and gaps in the current literature and provide some recommendations for future research directions.

					<strong>Abstract:</strong><br/> 
						Anomaly detection is an important problem in data analytics with applications in many domains. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in anomaly detection tasks applied to time series. In this tutorial, we take a holistic view of anomaly detection in time series, starting from the core definitions and taxonomies related to time series and anomaly types, to an extensive description of the anomaly detection methods proposed by different communities in the literature. We explore the literature and the proposed methods by demonstrating systems that help users understand the core computational steps of some methods and navigate benchmark results. Finally, we describe the problem of model selection for anomaly detection and discuss recent experimental results.

				<td class="tblCellCnt">
					<p/>
					<strong>Abstract:</strong><br/> 
					Query formulation is increasingly performed by systems that need to guess a user's intent (e.g. via spoken word interfaces). But how can a user know that the computational agent is returning answers to the "right" query? More generally, given that relational queries can become pretty complicated, how can we help users understand existing relational queries, whether human-generated or automatically generated? Now seems the right moment to revisit a topic that predates the birth of the relational model: developing visual metaphors that help users understand relational queries.<br/>This lecture-style tutorial surveys the key visual metaphors developed for diagrammatic representations of logical statements and relational expressions across both the relational database community and the much older diagrammatic reasoning community. We will survey the history and state-of-the art of relationally-complete diagrammatic representations of relational queries, discuss the key visual metaphors developed in over a century of investigating diagrammatic languages, and organize the landscape by mapping their used visual alphabets to the syntax and semantics of Relational Algebra (RA) and Relational Calculus (RC).
